excitation to emission mapping:
blue excitation (470) to green emission
UV (415) excitation to isosbestic emission
yellow (560) excitation to red emission

IR LED is for behavior. Has NOTHING TO DO WITH FIBER.

there are two cameras: green and red

fiber 0 is most anterior
left side gets smaller number if matching anterior dimensions

patch coord A-D: Kenta doesn't remember how this came about. Seems like this should be removed.

Is there a place in light sources to add notes? For example, can we explicitly state that the IR LED is for face illumination (behavior)?

in file standards, we should say "ROI0 (corresponding to fiber branch0) values" instead of "ROI0 (corresponding to fiber branch1) values"
