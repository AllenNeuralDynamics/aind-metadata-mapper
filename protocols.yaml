# Protocol URLs for each modality
# This file maps modality names to lists of protocol.io URLs that are used
# in acquisition metadata. The mapper loads this file and includes the protocol
# URLs in the protocol_id field of the generated acquisition.json files.
#
# Format:
#   modality_name:
#     - protocol_url_1
#     - protocol_url_2
#
# The mapper uses get_protocols_for_modality() from utils.py to retrieve
# the protocol URLs for a given modality.
